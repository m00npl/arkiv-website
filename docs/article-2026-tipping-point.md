 Every business, community, and organisation relies on digital data infrastructure to store, share, and act on information. Even an ‘offline’ business will rely on data, held somewhere, in a digital form. Yet the foundations of that infrastructure remain surprisingly centralised. As we’re an organisation committed to data autonomy, Arkiv has a strong belief that now is the time to overhaul our collective approach to data, and ensure data truly becomes a first class citizen, across Web2 and Web3. +

 With 2026 shortly upon us, we’re reaching a turning point. Regulation is catching up. Data management costs are rising. Users and developers alike are becoming more aware of the need for greater control. Decentralised technologies are maturing to a point where they’re a viable solution beyond DeFi-centric use cases.                                                                                                                                                                                       +
